After cloning the Git repository or unzipping the file, follow these steps:

1. Run 'composer install' to install PHP dependencies.
2. Run 'npm install' to install JavaScript dependencies.
3. Copy the .env.example file to .env by running cp .env.example .env.
4. Generate an application key by running 'php artisan key:generate'.
5. Migrate the database by running 'php artisan migrate'.
6. Optionally, seed the database with fresh data by running 'php artisan migrate:fresh --seed'.
7. Compile the assets by running 'npm run dev' (Keep this process running).
8. Finally, start the Laravel development server by running 'php artisan serve'.

These steps will set up your Laravel application and prepare it for development or production use.
